## Getting Started

Just tell me who to research:

- "Research Stripe"
- "Look up the CTO at Notion"
- "Intel on acme.com"
- "Who is Sarah Chen at TechCorp?"
- "Tell me about [company] before my call"

I'll run web searches immediately. If you have the Attio CRM skill connected, I'll pull relationship data too.
